You are given a function `componentDidMount()` which is a lifecycle method that allows us to execute the React code when the component is already placed in the DOM .

This method is called during the Mounting phase of the React Life-cycle i.e after the component is rendered.





In React, there are several lifecycle methods that a class component can implement to control the behavior of the component at various stages of its lifecycle. These methods are called in a specific order as the component mounts, updates, and unmounts. Here's a list of the main lifecycle methods in the order they are called:

1. **constructor(props)**:
   - This is the constructor method for the component, and it is called when the component is first created.
   - You should call `super(props)` to inherit properties and methods from the parent class, and you can set up the initial state and bind event handlers.

2. **static getDerivedStateFromProps(nextProps, prevState)**:
   - This is a static method that is called when new props are received or before the initial render.
   - It allows you to compute and return a new state object based on the new props and the previous state.

3. **render()**:
   - The `render` method is responsible for rendering the component's content.
   - It is a required method and must return a React element, typically constructed with JSX.

4. **componentDidMount()**:
   - This method is called after the component has been inserted into the DOM.
   - It is often used for tasks such as data fetching, setting up subscriptions, or manually changing the DOM.

5. **shouldComponentUpdate(nextProps, nextState)**:
   - This method is called before a component re-renders and allows you to control whether the component should update or not.
   - You can compare the current and next props and state to decide if a re-render is necessary.

6. **getSnapshotBeforeUpdate(prevProps, prevState)**:
   - This method is called right before the most recent render result is committed to the DOM.
   - It is often used to capture some information from the DOM, such as scroll positions, before changes are applied.

7. **componentDidUpdate(prevProps, prevState, snapshot)**:
   - This method is called after a component has been updated and re-rendered in the DOM.
   - It is commonly used for tasks like making network requests based on prop changes or interacting with the DOM after an update.

8. **componentWillUnmount()**:
   - This method is called right before a component is removed from the DOM.
   - It is used for cleanup tasks such as unsubscribing from data sources or timers to prevent memory leaks.

These are the core lifecycle methods in class components. However, it's important to note that some of these methods, such as `componentWillMount`, `componentWillReceiveProps`, and `componentWillUpdate`, have been deprecated in recent versions of React, and you should use the newer methods like `componentDidMount`, `getDerivedStateFromProps`, and `componentDidUpdate` for similar functionality. Additionally, with the introduction of functional components and hooks, many of these lifecycle methods are less commonly used in modern React applications.
